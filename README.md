# PCA-Antenna-Terahertz-Frequency
This repository contains the design files for a PCA (Photoconductive Antenna) antenna optimized for the terahertz frequency band, developed using CST Microwave Studio. The project aims to explore antenna performance within the terahertz spectrum, which is significant for applications in imaging, spectroscopy, and high-frequency communications.
